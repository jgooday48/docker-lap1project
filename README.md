# docker-lap1project

## Instructions
- Clone this repo by running `git clone https://github.com/jgooday48/docker-lap1project` in the terminal in an empty directory
- Open the docker application
- Run `docker compose up` in the terminal
- A new container named `quiz_api` will be automatically created
- Wait approximately 60 seconds for the initial start up to run
- You will be able to use the application once the npm packages for the front end have been installed
- Once successfully running, type `http://localhost:8080/` or `http://localhost:3000/` in Chrome to access the front end or back end respectively
- If the front end is running slowly, wait approimately 60s for it to fully load and the app should run smoothly
- To exit, in a separate terminal, run `docker compose down` (make sure this terminal is in the same directory as the one you are running the container from)
